# Linear-regression-techniques
Jupyter notebook that has functions to compute least squares regression with and without SKlearn, and Least absolute deviation (LAD) regression.
The main difference between the least squares method (using SKlearn or not) and LAD regression is that LAD regression is less sensitive to outliers.
Least squares will always have a higher R^2 value than LAD regression.
